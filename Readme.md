=====================================

## To Submit this Assignment
- fork this repository
- write all of your code in a directory named `lab-#`; + `<your name>` **e.g.** `lab10-amanda`
- push to your repository
- submit a pull request to this repository
- submit a link to your PR in canvas

## Directions
Build an api that creates and saves individual tasks. Think of tasks like:
1. "Take Cat to Vet"
2. "Eat Ice Cream", etc... 

Don't worry about grouping these tasks just yet, only focus on the individual items. 

1. Use Postman or Fiddler to test your connections
2. Have the Create/Read/Update/Delete commands
3. use asyncrounous programming (async...await)
3. Deploy your applicaiton to Azure
4. Remember about routing (hint: /api/[controller]), and constraint tokens {int:id} above any actions

## ReadMe
A README is a module consumer's first -- and maybe only -- look into your creation. The consumer wants a module to fulfill their need, so you must explain exactly what need your module fills, and how effectively it does so.
<br />
Your job is to
1. tell them what it is (with context)
2. show them what it looks like in action
3. show them how they use it
4. tell them any other relevant details
5 **Include a link to your deployed app in your Readme**
<br />

This is ***your*** job. It's up to the module creator to prove that their work is a shining gem in the sea of slipshod modules. 
Since so many developers' eyes will find their way to your README before anything else, quality here is your public-facing measure of your work.

<br /> Refer to the sample-README in the class repo for an example.

## Rubric
- 7pts: Program meets all requirements described in Lab directions
- 3pts: Code meets industry standards

- **Readme.md and unit tests required for submission. Missing readme document and tests will result in a best score of 2/10**
- **Program must build sucessfully and tests MUST be passing**
